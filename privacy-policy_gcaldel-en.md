## Data collected and permissions required

The App accesses the user's Google Calendars. No information from these calendars is stored permanently by the app or made available to third parties. Some data is persisted for informational purposes: The date/time of last deletion, number of deleted items for last deletion, and total number of deleted items. This data is stored locally only, never leaves the device, and is not made available to third parties.

The app requires read/write access to your Google Calendars. This is technically necessary for selecting past events and deleting them. No other operations are done on your calendar items.
