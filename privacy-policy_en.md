## Data collected and permissions required

Each user enters a player name when starting the app. This name is not stored permanently by the app or made available to third parties. Exiting the app deletes the name.

The app requires access to the camera. This is technically necessary for a player (including the one who additionally plays the bank) to pay play money to another. The payment takes place via a QR code that is created on the payer's device and scanned with the camera on the recipient's device. Scanning uses the library https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded, please visit there for further information about the functionality of the library itself. Otherwise, the camera is not used by the app. It does not permanently store photos or makes them available to third parties.
